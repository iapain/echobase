PEER CHAT/CALL
- user has unique id, Peer is created based on this id

- user can chat with many other users in different browser and/or tabs/windows
  - problem: we can establish only one Peer for given id, call to user is per its peer's id so we need to know what is the current user peer id
  - solution: we need to serialize somehow Peer object and then deserialize it when needed. Is it possible?
  - another solution: we can allow only one session at the moment

- user can have only one audio/video call (either one-to-one or conference)


ROOM
- we get participant list from rooms

- one-to-one call
  - make a room for 2 people, with given id
  - allow connection to this room only for those people

- conference call
  - make a room for n people (n=5?)
  - allow connection to this room only for those people

- room has to have methods for adding and getting participants
